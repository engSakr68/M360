# URL Launcher iOS Privacy Bundle Fix

## Problem
The iOS build fails with the error:
```
Build input file cannot be found: '/Volumes/Untitled/member360_wb/build/ios/Debug-dev-iphonesimulator/url_launcher_ios/url_launcher_ios_privacy.bundle/url_launcher_ios_privacy'
```

## Solution
The privacy bundle for `url_launcher_ios` has been created and is available at:
- `ios/url_launcher_ios_privacy.bundle/url_launcher_ios_privacy`

## What was done
1. Created the `url_launcher_ios_privacy.bundle` directory
2. Added the required privacy manifest file with proper content
3. Created build scripts to ensure the bundle is available during build
4. Verified the bundle structure and content

## Files created/modified
- `ios/url_launcher_ios_privacy.bundle/url_launcher_ios_privacy` - Privacy manifest
- `ios/build_with_privacy_fix.sh` - Build script with privacy verification
- `ios/ensure_privacy_bundles.sh` - Comprehensive privacy bundle ensure script

## Next steps
1. Try building your iOS app again
2. The privacy bundle should now be found during the build process
3. If issues persist, check that the Podfile includes the privacy bundle copy scripts

## Privacy Bundle Content
The privacy bundle contains the following API access declarations:
- UserDefaults access (CA92.1)
- File timestamp access (C617.1)
- System boot time access (35F9.1)
- Disk space access (85F4.1)

This is required for iOS 17+ privacy manifest compliance.
